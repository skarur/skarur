**Appendix I: Details**

There are no restrictions in using TAD Designer Lite other than these:

a) This software can only be used after obtaining a registration at the one of the TADWEBSITES. This registration is available free for the stated versions in this license, and it does not require to reveal any of your personal details if you so wish. If you do provide your email; a newsletter may be sent to the registered email address – which you can unsubscribe from, if you so wish. The website will not send you spam or any other unsolicited information. Critical emails - that pertains to the security and other such matters – may be sent.

b) If you plan to keep a TAD model file created using your copy of this software for yourself; without revealing its contents to anyone else other than members directly working on your project, you are not obliged to us at all. Even if you do use the file for your commercial benefit you are not obliged to us. For e.g. You can use the file to create an architectural project.

But if you to reveal the contents of the TAD file you've created to anyone else other than yourself, AND such a person is an anonymous person or potentially anonymous person then you must place such a file at one of the TADWEBSITES (or any other site that we may announce from time to time) and transfer your files using the rules of that website.

c) Do not reverse-engineer this Software and/or write something equivalent and/or attempt to patent parts/whole of this software. Why not join us instead, and work for the common good?

d) If you are interested in advocating this Software please note that we only permit notifications on public website discussion boards and Wikis. Under no circumstances shall mass email (spam) be sent to anonymous users either by email or on USENET. You may email information on TAD to people whom you know and while informing them, kindly make them aware of this explanation in this license.

**Appendix II: Examples**

a) Say you create a TAD model for a building, which you now want to sell to fellow architects who could use it as a case-study. That file must be sold only via the appropriate TADWEBSITES

b) Say you create a TAD model for a building and you want to get it rendered from a service provider who will render it for you, then you should ideally export it to a renderable format (e.g. Renderman) and give the exported file to the rendering service. If you plan to give the TAD model itself to the rendering service, then it must be done via an appropriate TADWEBSITES

c) Say you work in your office and you create a TAD model for designing your own or your clients project and you are not interested in revealing your design and/or relinquishing the copyrights to your work to anyone else. In such a case you are not obliged to us. You are then free to make private arrangements on how and where your file can be used for your own architectural works.

We are only concerned with where you place the files you produce for anonymous distribution. To put it simply: if the files are to be placed outside your own computers for access of others other than your own staff or your clients or your consultants – all directly working on the same project; we would want you to route those files through a suitable site on TADWEBSITES

d) Say you wrote some special tutorial for TAD and you now want to give that away or sell it to other users who you potentially do not know. You are allowed to do it only using TADWEBSITES if there was at least ONE TAD file in that tutorial. Note that you may not have not created the entire tutorial using TAD itself, but if the tutorial bundles at least one TAD file that you created in TAD, it qualifies for this rule

e) If you created a TAD file that you want to distribute to your own staff working on a remote location using the Internet, you are NOT obliged to do it through our TADWEBSITES.

f) If you liked TAD so much that you want to distribute it yourself to your friend, then just write an email to your friend asking him to visit the appropriate TADWEBSITE used for registration. You are allowed to distribute the setup program for TAD you had obtained for yourself, to your friend. However note that you may have obtained an older version than what is available on the appropriate TADWEBSITES and you are obliged to inform your friend of such a possibility

g) If you are a developer of a Software which you feel you can bundle along with TAD, then you must first obtain written permission from Sabu Francis. You are not allowed to re-distribute TAD in any form either in whole or in any part, either bundled or standalone; on your own, on a CD, in a magazine, on your own website, or any other media that Internet makes avaialable
