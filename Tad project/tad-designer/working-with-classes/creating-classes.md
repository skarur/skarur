# Creating classes

Before reading this topic, you would need to know the [concept of classes and objects](https://docs.teamtad.com/concept\_of\_classes\_and\_objects)

You can create, edit, and organize objects of your project in the Class Pane. It is not possible to rename or delete the root class of the class tree. It is always called **Project**.

**The mechanics of creating class**

To create a class:

1. In the **Class Pane**, select **Project**.
2. Right click on Project, and click **Add class**.

To create a subclass:

1. In the **Class Pane**, select the class under which you want to create a sub class.
2. Right click on the class, and click **Add class**.
