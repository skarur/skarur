# Moving objects

1. Move the architect to the point where you want to move the object to.
2. Make the object that you want to move as the current object. The first helper and the architect must be on the same point.
3. On the **Model** menu, click **Move Object/s**. Alternately, you can press **F8**.

Note: If you select multiple objects, all the objects will move according to the current object.

You can drag the first helper of objects and move them using the mouse. If you do not select any object, the current object is moved.
