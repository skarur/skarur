# Rotating objects

1. Select the objects that you want to rotate.
2. Move the architect to the center of the rotation circle.
3. On the **Model** menu, click **Rotate objects**. Alternately, you can press **F7**.

The objects are rotated around the architect and at the corner of the selected object that is closest to the architect. If you do not select any object, the current object is rotated. You can drag the corner of the object with the second helper using the mouse and rotate the objects.
