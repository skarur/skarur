# An Appeal

_(**Note:** If you came here from the installer, don't worry. The installation is proceeding in the background)_

This is a personal appeal from me (Sabu Francis), the main developer of TAD (The Architect's Desktop).

TAD arose from a small office (Sabu Francis & Associates) in a small town (Navi Mumbai) at India long time back. Since 1989. A lot of energy, personal efforts and lots of money were spent to keep this project alive.

The fact, unfortunately, remains: _This idealism needs some money to sustain_

**I welcome any donation for this project using this paypal link:** [**https://paypal.me/sabufrancis**](https://paypal.me/sabufrancis)\
**Indians can also pay using this link:** [**https://imojo.in/tad**](https://imojo.in/tad) _**You can pay via bank transfer, etc there.**_

Thank you in advance.

_**At the very least, you can give more than a shout to fellow architects regarding this project?**_
