# Install OR Update TAD Designer Lite \[TAD Docs]

Use the instructions here to either install the latest version OR to update your existing copy

TAD Designer Lite is updated every once a while. When you start the software you can check the latest that is available on the Internet and compare it what you have on your computer. If a difference between the version on your computer and the version on the Net is found, _you would be automagically shown this page_ you are now reading here from the Internet.

**This is what you can now do to get an update or a fresh installation.**

Download the zip file [from here](http://teamtad.com/downloadtad.html) Extract the contents to a new folder and you would see the installer in that folder. It is called tadsetup.exe

_We take extreme precaution to ensure that the setup file is free from viruses, trojans, and malware. If your anti-virus is indicating that there is some problem with this file, then please write to us at admin@teamtad.com We have found that whenever we got such reports; the warning had no basis. They were \*false positives\* and the warning from the anti-virus can be safely ignored._

Run the setup program; _tadsetup.exe_ It should install the program just like any other software.

After you run the installer, TAD would be installed on your computer. Note that the installer does NOT allow you to run TAD when the installer itself is opened. You would need to quit the installer to run TAD.

When you run TAD for the first time, it will authenticate you. This process is extremely easy and it is described here TAD will expect that you have the membership of our teamTAD community at [Discord](../../.gitbook/assets/discordserver) . If you do not have a Discord teamTAD community membership, use this link: [https://discord.gg/KxuHQax](https://discord.gg/KxuHQax) This is important as it will verify all that.

Once TAD Designer Lite is installed and authenticated; you can use it straightaway.

**Notice: Earlier to version 6.8.1.2**\

TAD Designer Lite would ask for an authentication during the first time it is run after installation. This is explained here for versions _earlier_ to 6.8.1.2

**Authentication check is done every 30 days**\
