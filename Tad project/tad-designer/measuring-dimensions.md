# Measuring dimensions

You can measure the horizontal and vertical dimensions of an object in TAD. You must create an object and place it in a way that it intersects all the objects whose dimensions you want to measure.

To measure horizontal dimensions:

1. On the **Create** menu, click **Create new object**.
2. In the Create objects dialog box, under **New** enter **Name of object**.
3. Enter **Width** for the object.
4. Enter '0' for the **Height** of the object.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Place the object such that it intersects all the objects whose dimensions you want to measure.
7. In the Site Info Pane, under **Info**, select **Show dims**.

**Note**: Ensure that the helpers are on the new object.

To measure vertical dimensions:

1. On the **Create** menu, click **Create new object**.
2. In the Create objects dialog box, under **New** enter **Name of object**.
3. Enter '0' for the **width** of the object.
4. Enter **Height** for the object.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Place the object such that it intersects all the objects whose dimensions you want to measure.
7. In the site info pane, under **Info**, select **Show dims**.
